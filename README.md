# AI job shares vary significantly across U.S. counties. Data on county‑level AI job postings from 2014 through 2023 were obtained from Lightcast and merged with demographic and economic indicators from the U.S. Census American Community Survey (2013–22), BLS Local Area Unemployment Statistics and Quarterly Workforce Indicators (2013–23), County Business Patterns (2013–22), PatentsView (2013–22), and IPEDS (2013–22). We define AI intensity as the share of job postings mentioning AI skills, aggregate observations into “early” (2017–18) and “late” (2022–23) periods, calculate both levels and percentage‑point changes, and standardize all regressors (e.g., STEM share, labor‑market tightness) to z‑scores before estimating county and year fixed‑effects models. We modeled the percentage‑point change in a county’s share of AI‑related jobs as a linear function of standardized measures of educational attainment, innovation activity, and industry composition, including county and year fixed effects. Standard errors were clustered by county to account for within‑county correlation over time. A one‑standard‑deviation higher labor‑market tightness in 2017 is associated with a 0.073‑percentage‑point greater increase in AI job share between 2018–19 and 2022–23, holding other factors constant.
